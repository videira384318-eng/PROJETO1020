# **App Name**: QR Attendance

## Core Features:

- QR Code Generation: Generate a unique QR code for each entry/exit point, configurable via the UI.
- Timestamped Log: Display a timestamped log of each scan.
- QR Code Scanning: Scan QR codes using the device's camera to register attendance (entry/exit).
- Anomaly Detection: Use a tool that analyzes scan patterns and alerts for anomalies.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A saturated blue (#3F51B5) to evoke feelings of trust, reliability, and security relevant to the concept of attendance.
- Background color: Light blue (#E8EAF6), a desaturated version of the primary, creates a calm backdrop that ensures readability.
- Accent color: A vivid violet color (#9C27B0), slightly shifted in hue from the primary, adds a unique accent to important interactive elements such as the scan button.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', a sans-serif for headlines, lends a tech-inspired aesthetic, nicely matching QR code app use case. For body text use 'Inter' for improved readability in longer form text.
- Use simple, clear icons to represent entry and exit actions.
- A clean, organized layout to facilitate quick scanning and attendance registration.
- Provide smooth transitions and feedback animations after a successful QR code scan.
